<h3 align="center"> Covid-19 detection using CNN</h3>

## What we have built?
Convolution Neural Networks was used to great effect in building this Neural Network. Through transfer learning and a custom classifier, the classifier reached an accuracy of near 95% for the mobilenet model. While the amount of data available was limited, we have tried to solve the problem of generalization by using methods such as Dropout and Early Stopping. By efficiently training through a relatively small dataset, the model shows a high probability of the classification of Covid-19.
